# Mater-Salutis-Parish 

This is What i have collected from my time in mater salutis parish during my service 

The Mater Salutis Church was Established on September 17.2001 Which is Older than me And Currently has 1 active Priest named Fr. Hanz Christian P. Borbor its Diocese is  Archdiocese of Caceres if you don't know what Diocese means don't worry because a few hours ago i myself did not know it means In church governance, a diocese or bishopric is the ecclesiastical district under the jurisdiction of a bishop. And the Mater salutis church is under Archdiocese of Caceres Picture a short info about is that 



Caceres was established as a suffragan diocese of Manila on 14 August 1595 by virtue of the Papal Bull Super specula militantis ecclesiae of Pope Clement VIII. The Diocese once covered the entire Bicol Region, as well as the Provinces of Tayabas and Aurora
â€‹

On 29 July 1951, Pope Pius XII, with his Papal Bull Quo in Philippine Republica, elevated Caceres to an Archdiocese. Today, the Mother Diocese of Bicol is comprised of six suffragan dioceses, and ninety-three parishes.
